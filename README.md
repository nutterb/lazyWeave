lazyWeave makes the functionality of Sweave/knitr available to those who don't know LaTeX.  It is written for new and infrequent R users with the goal of making reproducible research a possibility while one learns the finer points of R.  The guiding philosophy for this package is that:

The majority of your time should be spent thinking about the science/statistics
Most of the remaining time should be spent thinking about how to code the science/statistics correctly
Only as much time as necessary should be used to think about how to present the results.

Ultimately, I recommend that anyone consistently using R should learn LaTeX and move on to use knitr.  At best, this is a temporary solution that may be used to create reporducible reports while one focuses on coding quality statistical analysis using R.
