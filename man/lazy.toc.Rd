\description{
Designates the printing of a table of contents, list of
figures, or list of tables.  Also provides functionality to manually edit
the contents of these lists
}
\details{
The level of detail a table of contents maintains is determined by
the counter \code{tocdepth}.  In most cases, it is set to 3, giving chapter,
section, and subsection.  To include subsubsections, it would be necessary to
include \code{lazy.counter("tocdepth", value=4, fn="set")}.
Use \code{value=5} to include paragraphs, and so forth.
