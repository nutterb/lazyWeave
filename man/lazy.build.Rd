\description{
Executes a command to build a pdf file based on a .tex or
  .html file.  For HTML files, compiles the figure into a subfolder
  and places all of the contents into a zip file
}
\details{
For TEX files, a call is made using \code{tools::texi2dvi} to
  compile a PDF file.

  For HTML files, the referenced figures are gathered, copied into a
  subdirectory and the HTML document and the figures are placed into a
  zip folder for convenient transfer.  All of the image links in the HTML
  code are modified to reflect the new location.  Lastly, a text file
  is added with instructions for unzipping the files for convenient viewing
  (but don't worry, no one ever reads this).
