\title{Add a Footnote}
\usage{
lazy.footnote(text, number = NULL, translate = FALSE, name, ref,
  counter = "footnote", size = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Text for the footnote}

\item{number}{Footnote number}

\item{translate}{Determines if \code{\link{latexTranslate}}
is applied to \code{text}.}

\item{name}{For HTML, a reference name to the endnote}

\item{ref}{For HTML, a reference name to go back to the text (from the endnote).}

\item{counter}{For HTML, counter to use for numbering the endnotes}

\item{size}{For HTML, the text size to use for the endnote}

\description{
Adds a footnote to the text in a .tex file.
In HTML files, an endnote is produced.  Links are
established between the text and the endnote for user convenience
}
\details{
Be warned that this is not a perfect function on the LaTeX side.
  If you use special characters that require that \code{latexTranslate} be
  turned off, you'll also need to turn of \code{latexTranslate} in
   \code{lazy.write}.  I'm including this as is for ease of use, but it
   does have some kinks to work out.

   \code{name} and \code{ref} are used to create links between the
   footnote marking in the text and the actual footnote.  Clicking
   on the links created will allow the reader to go back and forth
   between them.  The names may be similar, but exact matches may
   confuse the browser.
