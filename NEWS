Following the UseR presentation, I've decided to change my plans for this package a little. 
Instead of uploading a second package (referred to as lazyHTML), I will add the HTML functionality 
to lazyWeave.  An option will be set when the package loads to determine if the output is LaTeX 
or HTML.  This way, I only need to change the output option in options() in order to change the 
format of my reports.

Also, based on a number of requests, I will move the functions cattable, conttable, catconttable, 
and write.ctable into lazyWeave.  These were the functions that produced the summary table that
a number of people expressed interest in.  This move may only be temporary.  I may move them back
into CCFmisc when I get that package ready for CRAN (that could take a little while though).
