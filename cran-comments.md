## R CMD check results
NOTES: 

This package was orphaned early in July.  This was a failing on my 
part to get the maintainer e-mail transferred to my new place of 
employment.  The maintainer e-mail in this submission is delivered
through my new employer.

There was a note about possible misspellings in the DESCRIPTION
(win-builder, devel).  I have verified that the words in question 
are spelled correctly.

The note "No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped"
appeared on win-builder (devel) but not on the local install 
nor on travis-ci

There were no other NOTES, WARNINGS, or ERRORS observed.

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies for this package
at this time.
