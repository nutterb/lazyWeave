NOTES: 

This package was orphaned early in July.  This was a failing on my 
part to get the maintainer e-mail transferred to my new place of 
employment.  The maintainer e-mail in this submission is delivered
through my new employer.

There was a note about possible misspellings in the DESCRIPTION.  
The words in question are package names and I have verified 
that the spelling is correct.

There were no other NOTES, WARNINGS, or ERRORS observed.

## Downstream dependencies
