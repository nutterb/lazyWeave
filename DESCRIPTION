Description: Provides the functionality to write LaTeX code from within R
    without having to learn LaTeX.  Functionality also exists to create HTML
    and Markdown code.  While the functionality still exists to write
    complete documents with lazyWeave, it is generally easier to do so with
    with markdown and knitr.  lazyWeave's main strength now is the ability
    to design custom and complex tables for reporting results.
